This package defines different kinds of static content. "static" here refers to the fact that the user cannot alter the
content and interaction is limited to changing the presentation of content, and only in a way limited to that viewer.

What is, in principle, possible for static content: searching, collapsing, tabs.

What is not possible: changing content; graded exercise input; input that is permanently stored.
